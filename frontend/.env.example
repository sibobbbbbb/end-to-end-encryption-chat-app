# Example environment file for the frontend.

# Configure the base URL of the backend API.  When running the
# frontend locally alongside the backend (e.g. Bun/Hono server on
# port 3000), set this to "http://localhost:3000".  In deployment
# scenarios where both frontend and backend share the same origin,
# you can leave this variable empty or omit it entirely.
